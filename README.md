# DeepLearning_termproject

In the midterm project, the ResNet20 architecture for cifar-10 was implemented by modifying the resnet code. In the final project, di-fgsm and mi-fgsm were applied using the base code implemented with FGSM to increase the attack success rate compared to the base code. Please refer to the code and report for more information.
